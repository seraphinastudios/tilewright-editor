# Tilewright editor

Tilewright editor is an MIT-licensed Rust world editor for isometric and
top-down tile games, with built-in agent tooling. Humans and agents edit the
same world through one command engine: the desktop app, a headless CLI, and an
MCP server all produce the same reviewable changesets.

Tilewright is maintained by Seraphina Studios alongside
[tilewright-world](https://github.com/seraphinastudios/tilewright-world), the
world format and toolkit, and
[tilewright-renderer](https://github.com/seraphinastudios/tilewright-renderer),
the shared GPU renderer. Each game describes itself to the editor through a
game profile (object schema, layers, projection, movement rules, palettes), so
the editor carries no game-specific code.

## Development model

Development is primarily agent-driven, under maintainer direction, review,
provenance controls, tests, and repository validation. Direct human-written
code contributions are welcome under the same controls. See
[provenance](PROVENANCE.md) for the reuse record.

Maps, quests, art, and other content opened in the editor belong to each game,
with their own credits and licenses; they are not part of the editor's
MIT-licensed code.

## Architecture

```text
world toolkit release -> document adapter -> semantic commands/history
                                    |                    |
project/path policy ----------------+------> UI model ----+-> app
renderer release ------> scene/preview adapter ----------+
```

The world toolkit owns source syntax, lossless documents, schemas, catalogs,
diagnostics, compilers, semantic diffs, and atomic file transactions. The
renderer owns scenes and GPU resources. The seven editor crates own application
composition, project/tab and safe path state, document adaptation,
commands/history, UI panels/tools, preview integration, and deterministic test
fakes. None owns a parser, serializer, filesystem writer, renderer, network
service, or server lifecycle.

The editor opens world source trees with tilewright-world's `tilewright-source`
and carries out edits as its `tilewright-edit` transactions; it builds scenes
with tilewright-renderer 0.3. The production manifests target exact crates.io
versions, recorded with their repositories in `policy/released-dependencies.json`.
The World migration is pending their actual registry publication and a registry
lockfile; local candidate overrides are compatibility evidence only, never
release or package provenance acceptance.

`tilewright-editor-commands::History` provides semantic transaction preparation,
reviewable file diffs, explicit commit, and undo/redo. It checks the opened world
revision and inverse plannability, retains a durable recovery record through the
application's `RecoveryStore` before publication, and delegates every source
write to World. See [the transaction contract](decisions/0001-editor-architecture.md)
for required recovery integration and uncertain-publication handling.

## Build and validation

Rust 1.97.1 is pinned, and `Cargo.lock` records the resolved SDL bindings and
SDL source versions used by `--locked` builds. External dependency declarations
use compatible SemVer ranges so routine updates can refresh the lockfile
without editing a second version inventory. Linux builds need the native SDL
headers installed by `tools/install-linux-native-deps.sh`.

```sh
cargo build --locked --workspace
cargo test --locked --workspace --all-targets
cargo run --locked --package tilewright-editor -- version
cargo run --locked --package tilewright-editor -- open crates/tilewright-editor-testkit/fixtures/meadow
cargo run --locked --package tilewright-editor -- headless crates/tilewright-editor-testkit/fixtures/meadow
SDL_VIDEO_DRIVER=dummy cargo run --locked --package tilewright-editor -- window
tools/validate.sh
```

`tools/validate.sh` checks formatting, Clippy-as-errors, all tests/docs,
dependency architecture/licenses/advisories, provenance/assets, path/inventory
contracts, the shared-renderer empty viewport, SDL lifecycle, Linux release
dry-run/SBOM/reproducibility, and diff hygiene. GitHub also builds/tests/packages
on Windows and exposes one required aggregate check named `Editor validation`.

The editor never launches a game server; playtests are run by the consuming
game's own tooling.

## Safety and releases

[ADR 0001](decisions/0001-editor-architecture.md), the
[threat model](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md), and [mutable path table](docs/MUTABLE_PATHS.md)
define authority.

Every squash merge uses a Conventional Commit PR title and semantic-release.
Linux and Windows packages include checksums, CycloneDX SBOMs, provenance,
license, and third-party notices; no game content, server or client, recovery
data, or mutable project state is bundled.
