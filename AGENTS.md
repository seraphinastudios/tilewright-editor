# Tilewright editor repository guide

## Ownership and dependencies

- This repository owns the MIT native Rust world editor for isometric and
  top-down tile games:
  projects/documents, command history, panels/tools, document-to-scene
  adaptation, diagnostics UI, autosave/recovery, preview, and packaging.
- Consume released world toolkit crates for lossless syntax,
  schemas/catalogs, compilation, diagnostics, diffs, and atomic transactions.
  Never add a second parser, validator, serializer, or write path.
- Consume the released Tilewright renderer for scenes, GPU resources, viewport,
  semantic masks, picking, typography, and offscreen previews. Never fork
  renderer code or create editor-only projection, painter, lighting, cache, or
  pixel-picking behavior.
- Do not make editor builds or runtime depend on game clients, servers,
  protocols, or game-specific code. Game specifics arrive as data through game
  profiles. Preview is local rendering; playable tests belong to each game's own
  tooling.
- Local renderer/toolkit overrides stay outside committed manifests; production
  manifests retain immutable released dependencies.

## Documents and filesystem safety

- Toolkit documents remain authoritative. UI state holds views/selections and
  semantic commands, not alternate serialized truth or direct file writers.
- Every edit carries document/file revision preconditions and uses toolkit
  transactions so dry-run, diff, undo/redo, validation, and atomic publication
  share one path.
- Preserve comments, unknown fields, ordering, whitespace, line endings,
  nesting, and untouched bytes. Opening/saving unchanged data is byte-identical
  and targeted edits do not churn unrelated source.
- Use explicit project roots and write allowlists. Canonicalize/revalidate at
  the operation boundary; reject traversal, symlink escape, special files,
  generated/runtime targets, ambiguous case, and paths changed after review.
- Detect external edits and stale revisions. Validation, conflict, disk,
  permission, rename, or crash failure leaves source unchanged and recoverable.
  Keep bounded autosave outside source and never execute project code.
- Keep GPU handles renderer-private and filesystem authority toolkit-owned.
  Document-to-scene adaptation is read-only/deterministic; selection uses exact
  semantic masks rather than color inference.
- Keep headless project/document/command/UI models independent of SDL3, GPU,
  network, and real filesystem. Isolate native/unsafe code narrowly.

## Licensing, delivery, and validation

- New code/tests/docs/editor fixtures are MIT. Do not link, bundle, depend on,
  copy, or adapt GPL/AGPL source. Independent implementation is the default;
  any reuse of outside material needs an MIT-compatible license and an exact
  record (source, revision, destination, transformation, notice) in
  [PROVENANCE.md](PROVENANCE.md) and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
- Authored material keeps exact licenses. Preview/test assets require a
  source/author/license/digest/transformation/notice manifest; preserve legal
  metadata and fail on ambiguous inputs.
- Packages pin renderer/toolkit releases and carry checksums, SBOM, provenance,
  notices, and exact allowlisted assets. They must not bundle game content, a
  game server/client, source, or mutable state.
- Local issues and milestones own executable acceptance criteria.
- Prefer deterministic headless transaction/path/recovery tests and add
  malformed/large projects, path attacks, external edits, disk/permission
  failure, GPU loss, and repeated open/edit/save/reopen cases as relevant.
  Visual tests use the shared renderer, exact masks, explicit clocks/resources,
  and documented color tolerance.
- `policy/released-dependencies.json` lists the released renderer and toolkit
  crates and their source repositories for package provenance. Keep internal
  editor packages unpublished; application archives remain GitHub releases.
- Run the aggregate contract now present:

  ```sh
  tools/validate.sh
  git diff --check
  ```

  `Editor validation` owns formatting, strict Clippy, workspace tests/docs,
  dependency architecture/security/license gates, transaction faults,
  renderer/toolkit compatibility, and supported platform/package proofs.
- Use repository validation. Commits/PR titles use Conventional Commits;
  semantic-release owns releases/tags.
- Dependency review is advisory, including operational errors. Before merge, the
  implementing agent must inspect the latest run for the current PR head and
  read its job summary even when a bot comment exists, fix actionable introduced
  risk, or record explicit maintainer acceptance of existing risk. A comment
  from an earlier run is not current evidence; unavailable reports leave results
  unknown. Reporting applies to eligible PR runs where this workflow exists in
  the relevant PR/merge revision; removing branch filters does not backport it.
  License metadata reporting does not automate compatibility policy: existing
  repository license and provenance constraints remain authoritative. Validate
  workflow changes with actionlint and `git diff --check`.
