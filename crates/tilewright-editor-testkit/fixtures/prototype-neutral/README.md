# Authored geometric meadow

This is a tiny original MIT top-down editor sample by Seraphina Studios. All
pixels are newly authored integer geometry; no game art, Classic source, or
third-party images were copied. It illustrates editing and transitions, not
Classic visual fidelity or gameplay. COPYING contains the MIT license.

Open `fixture_world("prototype-neutral")` or this directory as an ordinary
Tilewright World 0.1 project. `preview.jsonc` declares editor-preview/1 resources,
capabilities and the default `main` plane, spatial layer 0, bounds `[0,0,8,6]`.
The marker `marker_1` starts at `(3,2)` on render layer `item`; its typed `label`
is `Trail marker`, and its nested typed `settings` holds `active` and `visits`.
Move it to `(4,2)`, change its label, or paint `floor` at the empty cell `(6,4)`
with `grass` or `sand`. The floor's grass/sand seam derives directional edge
prototypes through the released World's transition resolver.

For negative/cross-chunk picking, use the same world with bounds `[-2,0,4,3]`.
Chunk `[-1,0]` contains ground at x=-2/-1 and the read-only marker
`marker_negative` at `(-1,1)`; chunk `[0,0]` continues the ground at x=0/1.
The default catalog deliberately grants movement only to `marker_1`.

From the repository root:

```sh
python3 crates/tilewright-editor-testkit/fixtures/prototype-neutral/generate_assets.py
cargo test -p tilewright-editor-testkit
```

The generator's default mode checks exact bytes, hashes, dimensions, catalog
metadata and repository asset provenance without writing. Use `--write` only
when deliberately regenerating this fixture. ATX1 files are magic `ATX1`, two
little-endian u32 dimensions and exactly width*height*4 row-major RGBA8 bytes.
Ground is 32x32; the transparent amber sign is 24x40 with a distinct standing
silhouette. Rendering and projection are supplied by the shared renderer.
