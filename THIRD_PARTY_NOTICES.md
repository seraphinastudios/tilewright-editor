## Shared renderer UI font — OFL 1.1

`tilewright-render-ui` 0.6.2 combines MIT implementation with bundled Roboto Mono
font source and derived atlas, metrics and glyph data under **SIL Open Font
License 1.1 (`OFL-1.1`)**. The exact released registry archive is pinned in
`Cargo.lock`; its checksum and source/notice hashes are recorded in
`PROVENANCE.md`. Font attribution does not establish text-coverage acceptance.

Copyright 2015 The Roboto Mono Project Authors
(https://github.com/googlefonts/robotomono).

Source: `googlefonts/RobotoMono`, revision
`895ec691990d041dd727c7b5afa3ce56525d98e6`,

The shared renderer converts selected common-Latin/symbol glyphs to 20 px
bitmap/metric data; the editor embeds the immutable resources without further
font transformation. The synthetic solid texture and renderer/editor code
remain MIT.

The complete, unmodified upstream copyright and OFL 1.1 license are retained as
`assets/OFL.txt` in the UI crate and copied to
`licenses/OFL-RobotoMono.txt` in binary archives containing it. No Reserved Font
Names are declared in that notice. Preserve this notice with the font data.
`PROVENANCE.md` and `policy/font-notice.json` record the exact immutable source,
notice and manifest hashes; package provenance records the verified registry
crate and generated assets.

## Separate Unicode Noto source font pack (OFL-1.1)

The unmodified source font files in the packaged `font-pack/fonts/` tree remain under SIL Open
Font License 1.1. Their exact original licenses are retained at each family's
`OFL.txt`; `font-pack/manifest.json` records every original source/notice
path, author, copyright, digest and embedded name/license record from pinned
`google/fonts` revision `6c1dbe27dcf7d817d4b62cec033ba77fa8e2a5ec`.
